# Rogue Dice

A Unity-based dice rolling game with roguelike elements, featuring animated dice rolls, perks system, and progressive difficulty.

## Features

### ðŸŽ² **Animated Dice Rolling**
- Dynamic rolling animations with sprite cycling
- Rotation and scaling effects during rolls
- Smooth transitions between roll states
- Configurable animation timing and effects

### ðŸŽ® **Gameplay Mechanics**
- **Progressive Rounds**: Each round increases the target score
- **Reroll System**: Limited rerolls per round for strategic gameplay
- **Perk System**: Collect and manage perks that modify dice scoring
- **Resource Management**: Balance rolls and rerolls to achieve targets

### ðŸ”§ **Technical Features**
- **Modular Architecture**: Clean separation of game logic, UI, and dice mechanics
- **Event-Driven Design**: Unity Events for loose coupling between systems
- **Configurable Settings**: Easily adjustable game parameters
- **Debug Support**: Comprehensive logging and testing utilities

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Unity 6 or later
- Git for version control

### Setup
1. Clone this repository
2. Open the project in Unity
3. Open the main scene from `Assets/Scenes/`
4. Configure dice sprites and UI references in the Inspector
5. Play to start rolling!

### Animation Setup
The dice animation system requires proper sprite assignment:

1. **DieUI Components**: Assign all die face sprites (1-6) to the `allDieFaceSprites` array
2. **Animation Settings**: Configure timing, rotation speed, and scaling in the Inspector
3. **UIManager**: Ensure `dieFaceSprites` array is properly assigned

See `DiceRollAnimation_Implementation.md` for detailed setup instructions.

## Development

### Key Systems

**GameManager**: Orchestrates game flow, round progression, and scoring
**UIManager**: Handles all UI updates and player interaction coordination  
**DieUI**: Manages individual die animations and selection states
**Dice**: Core dice rolling mechanics and reroll functionality
**PerkManager**: Handles perk selection, application, and management

### Testing
The project includes test utilities in `Assets/Scripts/Testing/` for validating:
- Dice rolling and reroll mechanics
- UI interaction states
- Animation timing and coordination
- Perk system functionality

## Built With
