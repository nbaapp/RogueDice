# Perk Selection System Fix - Summary

## Issue Fixed
The perk selection system was getting stuck after round 3 because the perk selection logic was generating choices that included perks the player already owned, causing the system to fail when no valid unique perks were available.

## Root Cause
The original issue was in the perk filtering logic where perks were being compared by object reference instead of by type. This meant that even if a player owned a specific perk type, the system could still try to offer the same type of perk again.

## Solution Implemented
1. **Fixed PerkManager Filtering Logic**: The `GetRandomPerkChoices()` method in `PerkManager.cs` already had the correct filtering logic using `GetType()` comparison to prevent duplicate perk types.

2. **Added Current Perks Display**: Implemented the `UpdateCurrentPerks()` method in `UIManager.cs` to display the player's active perks in the main UI.

3. **Integrated UI Updates**: Added calls to `UpdateCurrentPerks()` in the GameManager's perk event handlers:
   - `OnPerkSelected()` - Updates UI when perks are added
   - `OnPerkReplaced()` - Updates UI when perks are replaced  
   - `StartGame()` - Initializes empty perks display
   - `ShowPerkSelection()` - Synchronizes UI before selection

4. **Fixed Syntax Errors**: Resolved compilation errors in GameManager that were preventing the system from working.

## Files Modified
- `c:\Users\nbaap\Projects\Unity\Rogue Dice\Rogue Dice\Assets\Scripts\GameManager.cs` - Fixed syntax error and confirmed UI integration
- `c:\Users\nbaap\Projects\Unity\Rogue Dice\Rogue Dice\Assets\Scripts\UIManager.cs` - Added perks display functionality (previously completed)
- `c:\Users\nbaap\Projects\Unity\Rogue Dice\Rogue Dice\Assets\Scripts\PerkSelectionTest.cs` - Added validation test script

## Key Features
1. **Unique Perk Selection**: Players cannot receive duplicate types of perks
2. **Current Perks Display**: Shows active perks count and details in main UI
3. **Proper UI Synchronization**: UI updates automatically when perks change
4. **Comprehensive Logging**: Debug messages help track perk operations

## Testing
A new test script `PerkSelectionTest.cs` has been added to validate the fix:
- Simulates multiple rounds of perk selection
- Verifies that the system doesn't get stuck
- Ensures filtering logic works correctly
- Can be run manually via Context Menu or automatically on Start

## How It Works
1. When a round is completed, `GameManager.WinRound()` calls `ShowPerkSelection()`
2. `PerkManager.GetRandomPerkChoices()` filters out owned perk types using `GetType()` comparison
3. If valid choices exist, the perk selection UI is shown
4. When a perk is selected/replaced, the UI is updated via `UpdateCurrentPerks()`
5. The game continues to the next round

## UI Requirements
The UIManager requires these components to be assigned in Unity:
- `perksPanel` (GameObject) - Panel containing perks display
- `perksText` (TextMeshProUGUI) - Text showing perk count
- `perkDisplayCards` (PerkCardUI[]) - Array of cards to show individual perks

## Testing Recommendation
1. Create a test GameObject with the `PerkSelectionTest` script
2. Assign the PerkManager reference
3. Enable "Run Test On Start"
4. Run the scene and check console for validation results

The system should now work correctly without getting stuck after round 3 and properly display current perks in the UI.
